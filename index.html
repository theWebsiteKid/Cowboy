            <p> <strong>Spike Spiegel</strong> 🚬 (スパイク・スピーゲル <i>Supaiku Supīgeru</i>) (born June 26, 2044) is a tall, lean, and slightly muscular 27-year-old bounty hunter born on Mars. Spike has a history of violent activity, seen through flashbacks and dialogue with the Red Dragon Syndicate. He is often depicted with a cavalier attitude, but occasionally shows signs of compassion when dealing with strangers.</p>

            <p>Born December 3, 2035, and known on his home satellite as the "Black Dog" for his tenacity, <strong>Jet Black</strong> 💪🏽 (ジェット・ブラック <i>Jetto Burakku</i>) is a 36-year-old former cop from Ganymede (a Jovian satellite) and acts as Spike's foil during the series. Physically, Jet is very tall with a muscular build. He wears a beard with no mustache, and is completely bald save for the back of his head.</p>

            <p> <strong>Faye Valentine</strong> 💝 (フェイ・ヴァレンタイン <i>Fei Varentain</i>, born August 14, 1994) is one of the members of the bounty hunting crew in the anime series Cowboy Bebop. She is often seen with a cigarette and in a revealing outfit complete with bright yellow hot pants and a matching, revealing top (and, on occasion, a bikini). She sports violet hair, green eyes, and a voluptuous body. Although appearing to be no more than 23 years old, Faye is actually around 77 years old, having been put into cryogenic freeze after a space shuttle accident, wherein she spent fifty-four years in suspended animation.</p>

            <p><strong>Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV</strong> 🤖 (エドワード・ウォン・ハウ・ペペル・チブルスキー4世 <i>Edowādo Won Hau Peperu Chiburusukī Yonsei</i>) is the self-invented personal name of an elite hacker prodigy from Earth. Her father calls her Françoise in one scene, but since he "forgets the sex of his own child, it's doubtful this is Ed's real name". "Radical Edward" is a very strange, somewhat androgynous, teenage girl claiming to be around 13 years of age. Her mannerisms include walking around in her bare feet, performing strange postures, and her gangling walk.</p>

            <p><strong>Ein</strong> 🧠 (アイン<i>Ain</i>) is a Pembroke Welsh Corgi brought aboard the Bebop by Spike after a failed attempt to capture a bounty. His name is most likely derived from "Einstein", after Albert Einstein, because of the extraordinary intelligence he possesses. Another possibility is that the name is the German translation of "one", in the meaning of him being considered a he or an it. It can also be interpreted that, in Japanese, the way dogs bark is "wan" (ワン, pronounced the same as "one"), hence the name "Ein".</p>
